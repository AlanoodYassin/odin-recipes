    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p> If you are looking for a kid-friendly dinner, look no further.  It’s one of those rare recipes that even the pickiest children devour, while adults still consider it a “grownup” food.  If you are having an informal gathering of family and friends of all ages, pigs in a planket is a perfect menu choice!  Pigs in a blanket is also a popular super bowl party dish.</p>
    <p> Pigs in a blanket come in all sizes – some people make it bite-size with small cocktail sausages, or you can make it with a regular size hot dog for a main dish.  I always make my pigs in a blanket big, with regular size hot dogs.  Wrapping lots of tiny sausages in dough is much more work than fewer big ones :)  Plus I’d rather serve them as a main dish than an appetizer, as it’s much easier to come up with quick appetizers (like guac/chips and a green salad) than a main dish that everybody likes.  Everybody except vegetarians that is, and if you have vegetarians in your party, you can make few of those pigs in a blanket with the imitation “vegetarian hot dogs” found in most grocery stores next to veggie burgers.</p>
